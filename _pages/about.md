Welcome to my academic website! 

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Bologna, under the supervision of Profs. [Emanuele Campiglio](https://sites.google.com/site/ecampiglio/) and [Bruno Conte](https://brunoconteleite.github.io/).

In my research, I study questions in **environmental** and **climate change** economics, using tools from **economic geography**, **trade**, and **production networks**.

I visited the Pompeu Fabra University in 2024 (jan-jun) and 2025 (jan-may).

You can download my CV <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bqzaes2swdq17xa04v0mi/CV_HM_082025.pdf?rlkey=1xlrc2jt802ytnqumq6unsq37&raw=1">here</a>.

**I am currently on the Job Market 2025-2026.**
